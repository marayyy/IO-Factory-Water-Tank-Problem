# IO-Factory-Water-Tank-Problem

The water tank problem involves determining the amount of water stored between blocks of different heights. Given a sequence representing the heights of the blocks, the task is to compute the total units of water trapped between the blocks. The objective is to build a web application using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to visually represent the solution. The application should generate an SVG shape or a table view to display the blocks and highlight the water-filled sections. The expected output for a given input sequence [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 4, 0] would be 18 units of water.
